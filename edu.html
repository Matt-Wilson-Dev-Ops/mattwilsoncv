					<h2>Big Play Games </br> Coaching & Mentorship</h2>
				</header>
				<p>Personal organisation, punctuality and focus were lacking across the company. </br>
					Over the course of my time as COO within Big Play Games I worked closely with all three owners<br />
					and each of our staff members, particularly those within head-office, to better understand the<br />
					the value in utilising calendars, daily planners (both digital and paper), short, medium and long term goals<br />
					and having a postitive perspective on possessing a deadline for each task.

						<h2>Applications & Methods</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The following are some of the applications and methods that were implimented:<br />
					- GSuite: Email, Calendars, Meeting Requests, Cloud Storage.<br />
				    - Monday.com: Excel with a more user friendly UI, great for projects.<br />
				    - Draw.io: Invaluable when planning flow charts or story boards for projects.<br />
				    - Agile Gannt: I trained our design team to use these during projects.</p>

						<h2>Mentorship & Coaching</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The transition from start-up to company was not an easy one for many of the pre-exisiting staff and owners.
						It required them to communicate, be punctual and be able to adhere to the deadlines they themselves were setting.<br /><br />
						A significant amount of time was spent training and educating all of the staff on the importance of utilising calendars and meeting
						requests to not only ensure they themselves attend, but to also track and log attendance and notes.<br /><br />
						Meeting agendas, payment due dates, tool box chats, weekly staff catch-ups, among many others, were all being neglected.<br />
						Having had a significant amount of experience working with tailored corporate solutions and Microsofts extensive 365 suite I was able
						to see the incredible value in leaning on these types of tools to assist in managing the weakness many possess in this area.<br /><br />
						There is something to be said about personal philosophy's surrounding puncuality and reliablity, but I firmly believe that with enough
						guidance and the right set of tools, anyone regardless of age or background can be supported to achieve a level of professional integrity
						that will continue to inspire and encourage entire teams to follow suit.
