					<h2>Logan Safety Camera Program</br>Interactive Dashboard</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The monitoring room showed need for information, policies, procedures, files and footage to be easily accessible by </br>
				any and all staff members. Due to the volume of different drives and storage locations this proved quite difficult. </br>
				Additionally, a request was submitted from the director and program leader to create an entirely paperless, digital environment.</br>
				In response I created a solution in the form of a local web page/application.

						<h2>The Dashboard & Monitoring Room Display </h2>
					</header>
					<p>The volume of documentation required for day to day workflow within the monnitoring room was staggerring. Manuals, OH&S, court documentation, on-site
					registers and more were being filled out throughout the entire 24 hours of each work day.</br></br>
					It took me several weeks to complitely digitize all of the procedures and policies while also updating them. This alone removed an entire filing cabinets
					worth of documents for achriving and allowed every staff memeber access information for everything from turning their work station on to distributing footage
				    to QPS.</br></br>
				    The dashboard also contained a live weather map courtesy of the BOM, contact details for every station and senior police officer, streamlined access
				    to every drive containing footage accurately labelled and lastely the means to easily burn footage either to a disc or usb without the need for 
				    external software. </br></br>

						<h2>Personnel Sign-in Display</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Every individual regardless of their position in Council or QPS were required to sign in on a tablet located in the secured foyer before
					entering the monitoring room.</br></br>
					The company council commissioned for the software did not enable that information to be displayed anywhere except the device itself.</br></br>
					This caused my direct supervisor a great deal of inconvenience. I designed and implimented an application of sorts utilising google sheets as
					a personell database and a series of my own programs to pull data retrieved from emails sent by the tablet to always display staff on site 
					on a wall mounted monitor.</br></br>
					The adjacent monitor was set up to push and pull data from a google slides designed to be easily edited by staff to communicate the location
					of any current and future operations.</br>
					Information surrounding site rules and policies were also included here.
