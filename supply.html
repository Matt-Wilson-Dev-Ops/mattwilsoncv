				<p>Implimenting a means to order, receive, stock, sell and restock from scratch </br>truly proved to be challenging without any prior infastructure or process.</br> Below is a snapshot of the systems before and after my employment at </br> Big Play Games on October 2019.<br />

					<p>Big Play Games had no means of tracking inventory, stock orders or managing cashflow 
						during this period. You will notice there is not a continual flow of process, after a sale was completed plans
				for re-ordering stock would only occur in the event a staff member noticed it was required. Gross and net were never considered, only revenue.</p>

					<p>Every aspect of the business is now tied to a central application, DEAR Inventory. The accounting software, point of sale, shipping software and website all form an easy to trouble shoot and manage digital ecosystem with DEAR at it's core. 
					A strict process is in place for every aspect of the supply chain ensuring preservation of efficieny and cost effective work practices. </p>
