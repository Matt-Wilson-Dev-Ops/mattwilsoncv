					<h2>Logan Safety Camera Program</br>Total Area of Camera Coverage</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The Logan City Council is responsible for 959 km² making it one of the largest local councils in the country.</br>
				A significant amount of information is required to adequately maintain, monitor and grow a technological network </br>
				of this magnitude. Below are some examples of how I was able to contribute to the programs workflow.

						<h2>Total Camera FOV Coverage</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Given the challenges surrounding monitoring such a large area, posed along with the natural obstacles, it was often difficult if not impossible early on
				for the Queesland Police Service to know what each camera had within is potential field of view. </br>It became clear that with so many new cameras coming online over such a short period of time (5 times the initial amount over 12 months) the personnel
				in the monitoring room would soon face the same struggles as QPS.</br></br>
				My solution was a document that contained each camera's individual FOV as well as the m² it was able to cover. This took the better part of 3 months for me 
				to complete and had to be updated with each new installation, but it proved to be invaluable to aid in determining the percentage covered in each suburb, 
				district and Logan as a whole.	  </p>

						<h2>Installation Reporting</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Capital Works schedules held strict time lines for each sites completion as well as a budget limit that required prioritisation of sites based on
					several contributing factors. </br>
					The program initially had no way of determining site priority or a database containing information on sites previously considered.</br>
					This audit was the first that was required to be very visually appealing as its secondary use was to communicate to councillors and stakeholders
					why a site they had requested was or was not a high priority for installation. </br></br>
					The sheet ended up as an invaluable asset during the following round of federal funding applications as it contained statements made by reputable QPS 
					officers requesting installations in locations deemed to be high priority, allowing us access to a larger budget. </p>
