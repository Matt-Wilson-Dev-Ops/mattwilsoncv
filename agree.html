						<h2>Health & Safety</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Outsourcing the documentation through an external company specializing in HR and OH&S saved a significant amount of time. This enabled
					me to focus on designing and implementing processes to utilise the policies and prodedures being provided. Utilising a cloud based storage solution
				I was able to empower every employee to access all of our forms and documents from their mobile devices.</p>

						<h2>Role Structure, Expectations & Agency</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Poor communication and a lack of clear channels was very clearly creating issues across every aspect of the company and had been for the past 3 years. Implementing clearly defined roles accompanied with expectations and a great degree of agency and trust almost immediately solved this. Supervisory positions enabled
					safe places for staff to escalate and communicate, greatly improving efficiency and the overall happiness of our employees.  </p>
