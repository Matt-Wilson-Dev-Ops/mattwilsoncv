					<h2>Logan Safety Camera Program</br></br>
					Licence Plate Recognition Data</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The company who designed the Video Monitoring Software used to monitor the LSCP cameras included the ability for certain cameras </br>
				to read and store information of licence plates passing through their FOV.</br></br>
				There was a significant issue in that this information was not retrievable by the monitoring officers</br>
				without technical assistance once a pre-determined period had passed.</br>
				In response to this need, I created a solution through a user friendly application accessing the database.

						<h2>LPR Data Retrieval </h2>
					</header>
					<p>The need to have this information at the fingertips of our staff was paramount. It enabled fast responses to QPS which increased their chances
					of apprehending suspect vehicles.</br></br>
					Utilising languages such as SQL, PHP, JS and HTML I designed a solution to allow anyone access to plates passing through cameras from any time period.</br>
				    The challenge here was to enable this functionality without allowing users to directly interact with the database.</br></br>
				    A very user friendly yet restricted and as a result safe application was conceived. Provided the staff member had the plate they would be able to see
				    the cameras it passed through, the times down to the second and a rough frequency for its movements.</br></br>
				    This project proved to be invaluable to the LSCP and QPS.
