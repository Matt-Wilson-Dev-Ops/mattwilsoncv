					<h2>Logan Safety Camera Program</br>Reports & Auting Infastructure</h2>
				</header>
				<p>The LSCP had 522 Cameras as of my last day within the organisation. These were required to be audited daily</br>
				and that information was paramount to their maintence and repair for continued operation. The reporting also facilitated </br>
				determining the viablility and importance of a location for possible installation as well as continued federal capital investment.</br></br>
				This became challenging when my reports and audits started being presented to councillors and stakeholders, </br>meaning they were not longer able
				to just be functional, they also had to be aesthetically sound.	</p>

						<h2>Daily Audit</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Prior to my position the daily audit was conducted completely manually by personnel on site. This was done by going through each camera one at a time
					and ticking "yes" or "no" to its current status. This was time consuming even with (at the time) 126 cameras. </br></br>
					I developed a sheet that was automatically updated every time a report was run from the Video Monitoring Software. This mean't that no user interaction with the
					sheet was required and as a result the audit that initially took upwards of 2 hours to complete was ready for presentation after only 5 minutes spent each morning regardless of the number of cameras operating.
				</br>This was achieved by simply adjusting where the monitoring software deposited the audit and it's format to allow excel to utilise it's information. </br></br>
					The audit provided the CTO with averages and totals for uptime, downtime, time of activation and deactivation down to the second it occurred and an error to follow up.  </p>

						<h2>Installation Reporting</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Capital Works schedules held strict time lines for each sites completion as well as a budget limit that required prioritisation of sites based on
					several contributing factors. </br>
					The program initially had no way of determining site priority or a database containing information on sites previously considered.</br>
					This audit was the first that was required to be very visually appealing as it's secondary use was to comminucate to councillors and stakeholders
					why a site they had requested was or was not a high priority for installation. </br></br>
					The sheet ended up as an invalubale asset during the following round of federal funding applications as it contained statements made by reputable QPS 
					officers requesting installations in locations deemed to be high priority, allowing us access to a larger budget. </p>
